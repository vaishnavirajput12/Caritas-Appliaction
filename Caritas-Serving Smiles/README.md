<h2>In conclusion, the issue of food waste has become a major concern due to the rising population 
and development of countries. It is a critical problem that needs immediate attention, and 
various measures need to be taken to reduce food waste. The Android-Machine Learning based 
Food Waste Management system is an innovative and effective solution to connect donors and 
NGOs, and it helps to collect leftover food from restaurants and distribute it among those in 
need. This project not only helps to reduce food waste but also provides dignity to the needy 
by ensuring their right to nutritious food. The development of the Caritas application is a 
significant step towards addressing the issue of food waste and fighting hunger and 
malnutrition. With such initiatives, we can work towards creating a sustainable food system 
that benefits everyone in society.</h2>
